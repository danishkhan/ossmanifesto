title: OSS Manifesto
---

We are developers who want to support and sustain open source software.

We value:

* Respect
* Collaboration
* Healthy debates

We believe that all projects should:

* Have a readme file
* Have a contributing file
* List all core team members in the readme file
* Have a license file
* Have a changelog
* Follow semantic versioning
* Tag all major releases
* Provide documentation
